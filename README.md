A simple Wordpress addon that stores a database list of visitors to the site that identify as "Bot" in order to keep an eye out for "Bad bots".

The addon creates a basic admin page (accessed on the sidepanel in wp-admin) that lists all the visitors for the last 30 days. 

The addon clears out any dtatbase entries older than 30 days.
